# Readme for Folder `Section_A`

This folder contains solutions to 4 different problems in the form of 4 different programming languages:
- `anagram.py`: A solution to the problem of checking if two strings are anagrams of each other.
- `recursion.java`: A solution to a problem that involves the use of recursion.
- `palindrome.rb`: A solution to the problem of checking if an integer or a string is a palindrome.
- `caesar.ts`: A solution to the problem of implementing a Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher.

Along with the code solutions, there are markdown files for each solution which explain the code logic, 
provide comments on the Correctness, Efficiency, Style and Documentation for each solution.

Please note that this is just one of many ways to solve the problems and there may be other solutions 
that are more optimized or better written. These solutions should not be considered as the only or final solutions 
to the problems but rather as a starting point for further exploration and discussion.
