# Readme for Folder `Section_A`

This folder contains solutions to 4 different problems in the form of 4 different programming languages:
- `anagram.py`: A solution to the problem of checking if two strings are anagrams of each other.
- `recursion.java`:The recursion.java program takes a string as input, reverses it using a recursive method, and outputs the reversed string. Additionally, it outputs the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
- `palindrome.rb`: The solution to the Palindrome problem can be found in the palindrome.rb file, written in Ruby. This code takes an integer as input and returns whether it is a palindrome or not.
- `caesar.ts`: The solution to the Caesar Cipher problem can be found in the caesar.ts file, written in TypeScript. This code takes a string and a number as inputs and returns the Caesar cipher of the string.



Along with the code solutions, there are markdown for the `incorrect code` which explain the code logic, 
provide comments on the Correctness, Efficiency, Style and Documentation for each solution.

Please note that this is just one of many ways to solve the problems and there may be other solutions 
that are more optimized or better written. These solutions should not be considered as the only or final solutions 
to the problems but rather as a starting point for further exploration and discussion.
